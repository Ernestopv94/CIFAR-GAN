# CIFAR-GAN
A (not very successful) attempt at generating images using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the CIFAR dataset.

The models and images generated in each of the three parts have been attached to the models and images folders, respectively. This way there is no need to re-execute the code, which would take several hours due to training.
